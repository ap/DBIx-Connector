=head1 NAME

DBIx::Connector::Driver::SQLite - SQLite-specific connection interface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<DBIx::Connector::Driver|DBIx::Connector::Driver> provides
SQLite-specific implementations of the following methods:

=over

=item C<savepoint>

=item C<release>

=item C<rollback_to>

=back

Note that they only work with SQLite 3.6.8 or higher; older versions of SQLite
will fallback on the exception-throwing implementation of these methods in
L<DBIx::Connector::Driver|DBIx::Connector::Driver>.
