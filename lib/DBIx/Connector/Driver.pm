=head1 Name

DBIx::Connector::Driver - Database-specific connection interface

=head1 Description

Some of the things that DBIx::Connector does are implemented differently by
different drivers, or the official interface provided by the DBI may not be
implemented for a particular driver. The driver-specific code therefore is
encapsulated in this separate driver class.

Most of the DBI drivers work uniformly, so in most cases the implementation
provided here in DBIx::Connector::Driver will work just fine. It's only when
something is different that a driver subclass needs to be added. In such a
case, the subclass's name is the same as the DBI driver. For example the
driver for DBD::Pg is
L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg> and the driver
for DBD::mysql is
L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::mysql|DBIx::Connector::Driver::mysql>.

If you're just a user of DBIx::Connector, you can ignore the driver classes.
DBIx::Connector uses them internally to do its magic, so you needn't worry
about them.

=head1 Interface

In case you need to implement a driver, here's the interface you can modify.

=head2 Constructor

=head3 C<new>

  my $driver = DBIx::Connector::Driver->new( $driver );

Constructs and returns a driver object. Each driver class is implemented as a
singleton, so the same driver object is always returned for the same driver.
The C<driver> parameter should be a Perl DBI driver name, such as C<Pg> for
L<DBD::Pg|DBD::Pg> or C<SQLite> for L<DBD::SQLite|DBD::SQLite>. If a subclass
has been defined for C<$driver>, then the object will be of that class.
Otherwise it will be an instance of the driver base class.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<ping>

  $driver->ping($dbh);

Calls C<< $dbh->ping >>. Override if for some reason the DBI driver doesn't do
it right.

=head3 C<begin_work>

  $driver->begin_work($dbh);

Calls C<< $dbh->begin_work >>. Override if for some reason the DBI driver
doesn't do it right.

=head3 C<commit>

  $driver->commit($dbh);

Calls C<< $dbh->commit >>. Override if for some reason the DBI driver doesn't
do it right.

=head3 C<rollback>

  $driver->rollback($dbh);

Calls C<< $dbh->rollback >>. Override if for some reason the DBI driver
doesn't do it right.

=head3 C<savepoint>

  $driver->savepoint($dbh, $name);

A no-op. Override if your database does in fact support savepoints. The driver
subclass should create a savepoint with the given C<$name>. See the
implementations in L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg>
and L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle> for
examples.

=head3 C<release>

  $driver->release($dbh, $name);

A no-op. Override if your database does in fact support savepoints. The driver
subclass should release the savepoint with the given C<$name>. See the
implementations in L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg>
and L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle> for
examples.

=head3 C<rollback_to>

  $driver->rollback_to($dbh, $name);

A no-op. Override if your database does in fact support savepoints. The driver
subclass should rollback to the savepoint with the given C<$name>. See the
implementations in L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Pg>
and L<DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle|DBIx::Connector::Driver::Oracle> for
examples.
